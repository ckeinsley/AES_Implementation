# AES Encryption

Simply execute the appropriate binary for your OS. For example on windows, `./aes_encrypt_windows_64.exe`

This will read the file called `aesinput.txt` that is located within the same directory as the binary.

The main code is in [Main.go](Main.go). The helper code is located within the `operations` folder.
